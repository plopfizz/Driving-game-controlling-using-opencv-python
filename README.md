# Driving-game-controlling-using-opencv-python 

 Program to drive cars in games like Beach Buggy Racing using motion recognition.
 This program can give good results in low light conditions as well.
 
 requirements:-display only fists in the window as the thresholding is done to detect skin colour pixels        so the program can detect the hand as well. 
 
 
 
 TODO: Implement hand localisation using Faster RCNN for accurate and robust results.
